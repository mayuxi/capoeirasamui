## Manifesto

We are a non-profit collective of capoeira enthusiasts united by our love for the art of capoeira. Our primary goal is to embrace the joy of the game, and through it, to spread knowledge and awareness of capoeira and Afro-Brazilian traditions—music, movement, and language—across Koh Samui and throughout Thailand.

**Our Core Beliefs:**

1. **Unity Through Diversity**  
   We are not affiliated with any specific capoeira group, school, or lineage. We honor and respect all styles and traditions, believing that each brings unique value to the art of capoeira.

2. **Strength Through Training**  
   We train with dedication, pushing ourselves to become stronger, more resilient, and better human beings. Capoeira is our path to personal growth, discipline, and self-improvement.

3. **Community Connection**  
   We believe that the practice of capoeira can serve as a bridge, connecting the local community with travelers and expats from around the world. Through movement, we foster bonds that transcend borders and cultures.

4. **A Safe Space for Expression**  
   Our roda is a safe space for self-expression and collective expression. We encourage creativity, individuality, and the playful spirit that is at the heart of capoeira.

5. **Capoeira is for Everyone**  
   We stand firmly against all forms of discrimination—be it based on sex, nationality, religion, or any other identity. We believe capoeira is for everyone, regardless of background, and we welcome all who wish to join us.

**Our Mission:**

To cultivate a vibrant, inclusive community where capoeira can flourish, and to share the joy, culture, and tradition of capoeira with the world. We are here to play, learn, and grow together, united by the rhythm of the berimbau and the spirit of camaraderie.

Axé!
